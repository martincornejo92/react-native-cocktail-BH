# React Native Cocktail Search
A stupidly basic (and far from bug-free!) app for searching cocktails by name. Powered by [TheCocktailDB](http://www.thecocktaildb.com/).

## Set-up
This app was created in the Expo XDE. To run it, I'd recommend:
+ Cloning the repository
+ Downloading the [XDE](https://expo.io/)
+ In the XDE, hitting the "project" button (the lightning icon), then "open project", then uploading the repository.
+ You'll also need to download the Expo app on your phone. I'd recommend reading the Expo [docs](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v19.0.0/guides/up-and-running.html) about this.

## Notes
+ I have an Android, so that's all it has been tested on. Sorry.
